# Getting started

> First steps to start using verb

## First run

The first time you run verb you will be asked to provide two or three pieces of data so that verb has the necessary data to render your project's templates.

**Questions you'll be asked**

- `What's your name?`
- `What's your GitHub username?`
- `What's your Twitter username?`

You can skip any of these, but Verb may not be able to render certain templates without this information.

## verb init

Anytime you want to repeat the _first run_ questions, just run `verb init` to start from scratch.

## Recommended variables

Although verb only asks for three values, it's recommended add a few other commonly used variables as well. 

_(TODO)_


See the documentation for [cli commands](./cli.md), including [verb `--set`]('./cli.md#set') if you aren't sure how to set variables.
