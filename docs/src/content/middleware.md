(Some verbiage was borrowed from [express's middleware docs][express])

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the `file` object (or in {{name}}'s case, the `view` object), and a callback function that represents the `next` middleware in the applicationâ€™s build cycle.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

- Execute any code.
- Make changes to the `file` object.
- Call the `next` middleware function in the stack.
