All contributions are welcome! _Stars and tweets_ are always a great way to show your support! But we can definitely use some help with:

* [documentation](./docs)
* [writing unit tests](./test)
* [addressing issues](https://github.com/assemble/verb/issues)

_Or whatever value you'd like to add to the project! If you'd like to take a more active role, get in touch! We'd be happy to help you get started!_

### Pull requests

This project builds its our own documentation, so don't edit the readme or other docs directly, edit their respective templates instead.

To build the docs, first make sure [verb-cli](https://github.com/assemble/verb-cli) is installed globally (`npm i -g verb-cli`), then just follow these simple steps:

* Edit the templates in the ['docs/' directory](./docs)
* Run `verb`
* Pull request!

Thanks!
