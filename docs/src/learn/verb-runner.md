Allows metadata about tool currently running Verb to be used in templates (such as [grunt-verb][grunt], [gulp-verb][gulp], [verb-cli][cli], or a custom runner).

Type: `object`

Default:

```js
verb.runner = {
  name: 'Verb',
  url: 'https://github.com/assemble/verb'
};
```

For example, here is [verb-cli][cli]'s metadata for' `runner.name` and `runner.url`:

```js
verb.runner = {
  name: "verb-cli",
  url: 'https://github.com/assemble/verb-cli'
};
```

Used like this:


```markdown
_This file was generated by [{%%= runner.name %}]({%%= runner.url %}) on {%%= date() %}._
```

It would render to:

<!-- don't escape these templates! -->

```markdown
_This file was generated by [{%= runner.name %}]({%= runner.url %}) on {%= date() %}._
```
