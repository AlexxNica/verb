- Build API docs from code comments (this couldn't be easier!)
- Add a [.verb.md](#verbmd) markdown template to your project, and verb will build your readme using data from package.json.
- If you need more, create a [verbfile.js](#verbfile.js)! Verb can complex documentation too, including multi-page TOCs, cross-reference links, auto-generated links to dependencies and so on.
- Verb can run any [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) plugin
- Verb is built on top of [Template](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/template). All of Template's methods are exposed on the API.
- You can get by with a simple `.verb.md` markdown template, or do things like add layouts, pages, partials, helpers, register a template engine, load data or use a `.transform()` or two to modify that data at runtime.
