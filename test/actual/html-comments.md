# verb

> Verb makes it easy to build project documentation using simple markdown templates, with zero configuration required.

Exactly like the one on Star Trek. But instead of "stun" and "kill", this Verb generates markdown documentation, making it hands-down the most deadly markdown documentation generator on the planet (and probably others ones too).

Please [report any bugs or feature requests](https://github.com/assemble/verb/issues/new), thanks!

## Install

Install globally with [npm](npmjs.org):

```bash
npm i  verb --save-dev
```

## Contribute
All contributions are welcome! _Stars and tweets_ are always a great way to show your support! But we can definitely use some help with:

* documentation
* writing unit tests
* addressing issues

_Or whatever value you'd like to add to the project! If you'd like to take a more active role, get in touch! We'd be happy to help you get started!_

#### Pull requests

This project builds its our own documentation, so don't edit the readme or other docs directly, edit their respective templates instead.

To build the docs, first make sure Verb is installed globally (`npm i -g verb`), then just follow these simple steps:

* Edit the templates in the ['docs/' directory](./docs)
* Run `verb`
* Pull request!

Thanks!
