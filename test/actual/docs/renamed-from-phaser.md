You may be wondering, "Wasn't this project named 'Phaser' before?". Indeed, this is true.

You may also be wondering, "Did you change the name of this project to Verb because you only researched NPM before choosing the name Phaser, and then only after publishing the project on GitHub and promoting it on a popular podcast did you realize that a (also very popular) JavaScript project with the same name already existed on GitHub?"...

Whaaat? No, that's absurd. Only an idiot would do something that like. I don't even know where you heard that. Where did you hear that?

Anyway, the _real_ reason I changed the name to Verb is that Phaser wasn't nerdy enough and I wanted the name to be more familiar and easier to remember. Besides, Phasers shoot lame neon light at people, but Verb is the matter from which starships are made. Period. The other stuff you heard is lies spread by my enemies.

But this is all behind us now, so let's move on, shall we?
