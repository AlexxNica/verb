# verb [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/verb.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/verb)

> Verb makes it easy to build project documentation using simple markdown templates, with zero configuration required.

* Get [verb-cli](https://github.com/assemble/verb-cli) to use Verb globally from the command line
* Get [generator-verb](https://github.com/assemble/generator-verb) to add documentation templates, or initialize docs for new projects

## Meet Verb
Verb's CLI makes kickstarting new markdown documentation a breeze.

For example, to generate a readme for your project just create a template, `docs/README.tmpl.md`, and add the following:

```
# {%= name %}

> {%= description %}

Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem
accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam.
```
And Verb will build this into `README.md` **using data from your project's package.json**.

**Built-in tags**

Need more than simple variables? Use one of Verb's [built-in tags](#TODO: add link), like `date()`:

```
## License
Copyright (c) {%= date('YYYY') %} {%= author.name %}, contributors.
Released under the {%= license.type %} license
```

**Includes**

Include other documents, allowing them to be reused across multiple projects, or just to organize:

```
## Contribute
{%= docs("contributing") %}
```

That's it! _(More docs are on the way.)_ [See this gist](https://gist.github.com/jonschlinkert/9712957) for a more detailed example.

## Customize Verb

Verb is easy to extend, here are some examples ([verb-cli](https://github.com/assemble/verb-cli) will automatically use these):

* [example verbfile](https://gist.github.com/jonschlinkert/9685280), with custom `src`, `dest` and metadata.
* [example verbfile with logging](https://gist.github.com/jonschlinkert/9685144)
* [example .verbrc.yml](https://gist.github.com/jonschlinkert/9686195)

## Install
Install with [npm](npmjs.org):

```bash
npm i verb --save-dev
```

Be sure to install [Verb](https://github.com/assemble/verb) locally in projects that use Verb.

## Other tools

* Get [grunt-verb](https://github.com/assemble/grunt-verb) to automate Verb in your Grunt tool-chains
* Get [gulp-verb](https://github.com/assemble/gulp-verb) to automate Verb in your gulp tool-chains

_This file was generated by [Verb](https://github.com/assemble/verb) on March 23, 2014._,All contributions are welcome! _Stars and tweets_ are always a great way to show your support! But we can definitely use some help with:

* documentation
* writing unit tests
* addressing issues

_Or whatever value you'd like to add to the project! If you'd like to take a more active role, get in touch! We'd be happy to help you get started!_

### Pull requests

This project builds its our own documentation, so don't edit the readme or other docs directly, edit their respective templates instead.

To build the docs, first make sure Verb is installed globally (`npm i -g verb`), then just follow these simple steps:

* Edit the templates in the ['docs/' directory](./docs)
* Run `verb`
* Pull request!

Thanks!,Install globally with [npm](npmjs.org):

```bash
npm i  verb --save-dev
```,Verb's CLI makes kickstarting new markdown documentation a breeze.

For example, to generate a readme for your project just create a template, `docs/README.tmpl.md`, and add the following:

```
# {%= name %}

> {%= description %}

Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem
accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam.
```
And Verb will build this into `README.md` **using data from your project's package.json**.

**Built-in tags**

Need more than simple variables? Use one of Verb's [built-in tags](#TODO: add link), like `date()`:

```
## License
Copyright (c) {%= date('YYYY') %} {%= author.name %}, contributors.
Released under the {%= license.type %} license
```

**Includes**

Include other documents, allowing them to be reused across multiple projects, or just to organize:

```
## Contribute
{%= docs("contributing") %}
```

That's it! _(More docs are on the way.)_ [See this gist](https://gist.github.com/jonschlinkert/9712957) for a more detailed example.,Now that verb is installed, add a `README.tmpl.md` to a `docs/` dir in your project with this content:

```markdown
# {%= name %}

> {%= description %}

## Getting started
Install with [npm](npmjs.org) `npm i -g {%= name %} --save-dev`

## Options
{%= docs("options") %}

## Examples
{%= docs("examples") %}

## Author
+ {%= author.name %}

## License
{%= copyright() %}
{%= license() %}
```

Next, in the command line run:

```bash
verb
```

That wasn't so hard, was it? (It was? Tell us about it. Please [report any bugs or feature requests](https://github.com/assemble/verb/issues/new), thanks!).,Run Verb's 75+ unit tests:

```
mocha -R spec
```,Fields like `{%= name %}` and `{%= description %}` will be processed using data from your project's package.json. But sometimes you need more that that.

Here are some things you can do with Verb:

* Verb uses moment.js for `{%= date() %}`
* `{%= docs() %}` will include a file from the `docs` directory of your project (must have a `.md` extension)
* `{%= include() %}` like `docs`, but includes a "generic" file from [verb-readme-includes](https://github.com/assemble/verb-readme-includes)

#### Last, make sure you **use the correct variables** for your project!!

For example, if `author` if formatted as a string, like this:

```json
{
  "author": "Jon Schlinkert"
}
```
then use `{%= author %}`, not `{%= author.name %}`.


A few things to know about Verb:

- [x] If verb-cli finds a `.verbrc.yml` file it will be used to extend the context, set options, etc. See [this example](https://gist.github.com/jonschlinkert/9686195)
- [x] If a `verbfile.js` is found, verb-cli will try to run it. See [this example](https://gist.github.com/jonschlinkert/9685280)
