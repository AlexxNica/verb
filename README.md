That wasn't so hard, was it? (It was? Tell us about it, we'd love to know. Please [report any bugs or feature requests](https://github.com/assemble/verb/issues/new), thanks!).

## Use
> Use Verb from the command line.

```

## Contribute
All contributions are welcome! If you like the project, _stars and tweets_ are a great way to show your support. If you want to take a more active role and help with documentation, writing unit tests, addressing issues or whatever seems interesting, please let us know, we'd be happy to help you get started!

This project builds its our own documentation, so don't edit the readme or other docs directly. First, make sure Verb is installed globally, then just follow these simple steps:

* Make changes to the docs by editing the necessary templates in the [docs directory](./docs)
* Run `verb` to re-build the docs
* Do a pull request!

Thanks!
