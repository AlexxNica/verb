# verb [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/verb.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/verb)

> Verb makes it easy to build project documentation using simple markdown templates, with zero configuration required.

* Get [verb-cli](https://github.com/assemble/verb-cli) to use Verb globally from the command line
* Get [generator-verb](https://github.com/assemble/generator-verb) to add documentation templates, or initialize docs for new projects

## Meet Verb
Verb's CLI makes kickstarting new markdown documentation a breeze.

For example, to [generate a readme](https://github.com/assemble/generator-verb) for your project just add `docs/README.tmpl.md` with the following:

```
# {%= name %}

> {%= description %}

Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem
accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam.
```
And Verb will build this into `README.md` **using data from your project's package.json**.

**[Built-in tags](./docs/tags.md)**

Need more than simple variables? Use one of Verb's [built-in tags](./docs/tags.md), like `date()`:

```
## License
Copyright (c) {%= date('YYYY') %} {%= author.name %}, contributors.
Released under the {%= license.type %} license
```

**[Includes](./docs/tags.md#include)**

Easily include other documents. To use any markdown file in the `docs/` directory just use [`{%= docs() %}`](./docs/tags.md#docs):

```
## Contribute
{%= docs("contributing") %}
```

That's it! [See this gist](https://gist.github.com/jonschlinkert/9712957) for a more detailed example.

_(More docs are on the way! In the meantime, check progress in the [docs directory](./docs))_.

## Install
Install with [npm](npmjs.org):

```bash
npm i verb --save-dev
```

Be sure to install [Verb](https://github.com/assemble/verb) locally in projects that use Verb.

## Customize Verb

Verb is easy to extend, here are some examples ([verb-cli](https://github.com/assemble/verb-cli) will automatically use these):

* [example verbfile](https://gist.github.com/jonschlinkert/9685280), with custom `src`, `dest` and metadata.
* [example verbfile with logging](https://gist.github.com/jonschlinkert/9685144)
* [example .verbrc.yml](https://gist.github.com/jonschlinkert/9686195)

## Get some verb in your toolchain

* Use [grunt-verb](https://github.com/assemble/grunt-verb) with your favorite JavaScript task runner.
* Use [gulp-verb](https://github.com/assemble/gulp-verb) with your streaming build systems.

## Contributing
All contributions are welcome! _Stars and tweets_ are always a great way to show your support! But we can definitely use some help with:

* documentation
* writing unit tests
* addressing issues

_Or whatever value you'd like to add to the project! If you'd like to take a more active role, get in touch! We'd be happy to help you get started!_

#### Pull requests

This project builds its our own documentation, so don't edit the readme or other docs directly, edit their respective templates instead.

To build the docs, first make sure Verb is installed globally (`npm i -g verb`), then just follow these simple steps:

* Edit the templates in the ['docs/' directory](./docs)
* Run `verb`
* Pull request!

Thanks!
