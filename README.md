# verb [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/verb.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/verb)

> A project without documentation is like a project that doesn't exist. Verb solves this by making it dead simple to generate docs, using simple markdown templates, with zero configuration required.

* Use Verb to generate and maintain markdown documentation for your projects. Use [Assemble](https://github.com/assemble/assemble) to generate a website from your Verb docs!
* Get [verb-cli](https://github.com/assemble/verb-cli) to use Verb globally from the command line
* Get [generator-verb](https://github.com/assemble/generator-verb) to add documentation templates, or initialize docs for new projects
* Read [the documentation](./DOCS.md) to learn more about Verb.

## Install
Install with [npm](npmjs.org):

```bash
npm i verb --save
```

## Meet Verb
Verb's CLI makes kickstarting new markdown documentation a breeze.

For example, to [generate a readme](https://github.com/assemble/generator-verb) for your project just add `docs/README.tmpl.md` with the following:

```
# {%= name %}

> {%= description %}

Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem
accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam.
```
Then run `verb` in the command line and it will generate `README.md`, _automatically using data from your project's package.json to process templates_.

**[Built-in tags](./DOCS.md#tags)**

Need more than simple variables, like `date()`? Use one of Verb's [built-in tags](./DOCS.md#date):

```
## License
Copyright (c) {%= date('YYYY') %} {%= author.name %}, contributors.
Released under the {%= license.type %} license
```

**[Includes](./DOCS.md#include)**

Easily include other documents. To use any markdown file in the `docs/` directory just use [`{%= docs() %}`](./DOCS.md#docs):

```
## Contribute
{%= docs("contributing") %}
```

That's it! [See this gist](https://gist.github.com/jonschlinkert/9712957) for a more detailed example.

This is just a simple example though, Verb can easily build multi-page markdown documentation, with a fully-linked [multi-page TOC](./DOCS.md#toc), or even build a book!

_(Verb builds its own docs (WIP) too, check progress in the [docs directory](./docs)!)_.



## Customize
Verb is easy to extend, here are some examples ([verb-cli](https://github.com/assemble/verb-cli) will automatically use these):

* [example verbfile](https://gist.github.com/jonschlinkert/9685280), with custom `src`, `dest` and metadata.
* [example verbfile with logging](https://gist.github.com/jonschlinkert/9685144)
* [example .verbrc.yml](https://gist.github.com/jonschlinkert/9686195)

## Get some Verb in your toolchain
* Use [grunt-verb](https://github.com/assemble/grunt-verb) with your favorite JavaScript task runner.
* Use [gulp-verb](https://github.com/assemble/gulp-verb) with your streaming build systems.

## Test
Run Verb's 75+ unit tests:

```
mocha -R spec
```

## Contribute
All contributions are welcome! _Stars and tweets_ are always a great way to show your support! But we can definitely use some help with:

* [documentation](./docs)
* [writing unit tests](./test)
* [addressing issues](https://github.com/assemble/verb/issues)

_Or whatever value you'd like to add to the project! If you'd like to take a more active role, get in touch! We'd be happy to help you get started!_

#### Pull requests

This project builds its our own documentation, so don't edit the readme or other docs directly, edit their respective templates instead.

To build the docs, first make sure [verb-cli](https://github.com/assemble/verb-cli) is installed globally (`npm i -g verb-cli`), then just follow these simple steps:

* Edit the templates in the ['docs/' directory](./docs)
* Run `verb`
* Pull request!

Thanks!
