# verb [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/verb.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/verb)  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/assemble/verb.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/assemble/verb) 

> Documentation generator for GitHub projects. Extremely powerful, easy to use, can generate anything from API docs to a readme, for projects big or small.

Verb is the most powerful, extensible and easy-to-use documentation generator for node.js. 

**Heads up!**

As of v0.4.0, Verb now requires [verb-cli] to run. See the [getting started](#getting-started) section for details.

## Why use Verb?
It's magical and smells like chocolate. If that's not enough for you, it's also the most powerful and easy-to-use documentation generator for node.js. And it's magical.

**Features**

- Generate markdown docs, or HTML
- Generate a Table of Contents simply by adding `<!!-- toc -->` to any document.
- Include templates from locally installed npm packages with the `{%= include() %}` helper
- Include templates from your project's `docs/` directory with the `{%= docs() %}` helper
- Change the templates directory for either helper by passing a `cwd` to the helper: example: `{%= docs("foo", {cwd: ''}) %}`


- Build API docs from code comments (this couldn't be easier!)
- Add a [.verb.md](#verbmd) markdown template to your project, and verb will build your readme using data from package.json.
- If you need more, create a [verbfile.js](#verbfile.js)! Verb can complex documentation too, including multi-page TOCs, cross-reference links, auto-generated links to dependencies and so on.
- Verb can run any [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) plugin
- Verb is built on top of [Template](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/template). All of Template's methods are exposed on the API.
- You can get by with a simple `.verb.md` markdown template, or do things like add layouts, pages, partials, helpers, register a template engine, load data or use a `.transform()` or two to modify that data at runtime.
