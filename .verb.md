See the [release history](#release-history) for updates, news about new features, or to stay on top of breaking changes.

Also consider installing [update][]. Update works as a companion to verb by automatically updating your `.verb.md` and other templates, based on your preferences. Update is completely customizable and runs on plugins!

## Install

To get started, you'll first need to install `verb` globally using [npm][]:

{%= include("install-global") %}

***

## Usage

```sh
$ verb <command> [args]
```

## CLI

_(WIP)_

### Commands

#### help

_(TODO)_

Get started with Verb. 

```js
$ verb help
```

#### init

_(TODO)_

Get started with Verb. 

```js
$ verb init
```

Upon running `init`, verb will prompt you for answers to the following questions:

#### diff

Show a diff of a file's contents, pre- and post-render.

```js
$ verb --diff
```

**Example diff**

### Run tasks

To run a task on the `base` app, just pass the name of the task to run.

```sh
$ verb <task name> [options]
```

Unless overridden by the user, the `base` app is the default app that ships with Verb. This app doesn't really "verb" anything, but it will prompt you for a few answers (if you choose), to store data that's commonly needed by templates, like `author.name`, GitHub `username`, etc. 

**Example**

Run task `bar`:

```sh
$ verb bar
```

## API
{%= apidocs("index.js") %}

## Apps
_(TODO)_

## TODO

- [x] publish a fast, composable, highly extendable project app with a user-friendly and expressive API!
- [x] support sub-apps (to any level of nesting)
- [x] support streams, tasks, and plugins compatible with both [gulp][] and [assemble][assemble-core]
- [x] make it super easy to run specific tasks from any app or sub-app, programmatically or via CLI 
- [x] support _instance plugins_ that allow you to easily add functionality and features to verb
- [x] support any template engine
- [x] support using any number of template engines at once, so that different file types can simultaneously be handled by the engine that was registered for that file type
- [x] support templates as [vinyl][] files, simple to use template collections and lists (for pagination, sorting, groups etc)
- [x] support middleware that can be run on all files or specific files, and at specific points during the _build process_ (like `onLoad`, `preRender`, `postRender`, etc) 
- [x] 820+ unit tests
- [ ] create and publish apps (we created a handful of apps that we've been using locally, these will be published shortly)
- [ ] CLI docs (started)
- [ ] User help (e.g. when the user does `verb help` or just `verb`)
- [ ] API docs
- [ ] App guidelines and conventions

## Release history

**v0.9.0**

- `license()` helper has been removed in favor of storing the `license` variable on the context as a string. To update your `.verb.md`, just change `{%%= license() %}` to `{%%= license %}`.
