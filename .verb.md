## Usage

```js
var verb = require('{%= name %}');
```

## What is verb?

Verb is a documentation system that is simple and fast enough to use for generating the readmes for GitHub projects, but powerful and smart enough to build the most complex documentation projects around. 

Verb is also highly pluggable, with first-class support for instance plugins, pipeline (gulp/vinyl) plugins, routes and middleware, any template engine, helpers, and more. 

## Quickstart

**Install readme generator**

First, install the `verb-readme-generator` with the following command:

```sh
$ npm i -g verb-readme-generator
```

**verbfile.js**

Next, create a `verbfile.js` with the following code:

```js
module.exports = function(app) {
  app.extendWith('verb-readme-generator');

  app.task('default', ['readme']);
};
```

**Run verb**

In the command line, run:

```sh
$ verb
```

## verbfile

Your project's `verbfile.js` should either export an instance of Verb or a function.

**Instance**

```js
var verb = require('verb');
var app = verb();

module.exports = app;
```

**Function**

```js
module.exports = function(verb) {
  // "private" verb instance is created for this verbfile
};
```

Also, when a function is exported, we refer to these as [verb generators](#verb-generators). Verb generators can be locally or globally installed, and can be composed with other verb generators and/or [sub-generators](#sub-generators).
