A project without documentation is like a project that doesn't exist. Verb solves this by making it dead simple to generate documentation, using simple markdown templates, with zero configuration required.

## What is verb?

**Documentation system**

Verb is a documentation system that is simple and fast enough to use for [generating a readme][verb-generate-readme] for a GitHub project, yet powerful and smart enough to build the most complex documentation projects around.

**I just want to generate a readme, can verb do this?**

Yes! See [verb-generate-readme][].

**Highly pluggable**

Verb is also highly pluggable, with first-class plugin support. Moreover, verb also supports [gulp][], [base][], [assemble][], [generate][] and [update][] plugins.

### Why use verb?

**Why should I use verb, instead of X?**

Verb is not a _documentation generator_, it's a documentation system that can be used to create documentation generators like [documentation.js](https://github.com/documentationjs/documentation) and [slate](https://github.com/lord/slate). 

For example, [verb-generate-readme][] is a sophisticated readme generator that renders templates using data from the user's environment, like package.json and git config. For API documentation, verb-readme-generator uses template helpers.

## Highlights 

**Templating**

* Render templates with any node.js engine, including [handlebars][], [lodash][], [nunjucks][], and all [consolidate][] engines.
* Convert markdown to HTML, or render markdown templates back to markdown (see [.verb.md](#verbmd))
* Template collections
* Support for "pages", "partials", and "layouts" 
* Helper support (sync and async!)
* Middleware that can be used at any point in the render cycle

**Helpers**

* Generate a list of [related links][helpers]{helper-related} to other npm packages
* Resolve [reflinks][helpers]{helper-reflinks}
* More than 150 other helpers available from [template-helpers][] and the [helpers org][github]{helpers}

**Plugins**

Verb has rich plugin support, along with native support for [gulp plugins][], so if you want to publish a documentation site, you can do things like:

* Ignore files marked as "drafts"
* CSS minification or reduction
* SASS or LESS compiling and minification
* JavaScript minification, reduction or concatenation
* Asset copying or renaming
* Image compression
* HTML minification and linting
* RSS feeds
* Anything else you can do with [gulp plugins][]

**Generators**

Verb supports [generate][] generators, which are plugins that are registered by name and can be run by command line or API. Generators can also be published to npm and installed globally or locally.

See the [generate][] project and [documentation][generate]{docs} for more details.

## Getting started

### Installing verb

To use verb's CLI, you will first need to install it globally. You can do that now with the following command:

```sh
$ npm --global install verb 
```

This adds the `verb` command to your system path, allowing it to be run from any directory.

### init

If you want to test that verb works, while also initializing settings for the current project, run:

```sh
$ verb init
```

### Generators

All of the "real work" in verb is accomplished using generators. Now that `verb` is installed, you can run any [generator found on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=generategenerator)


**Install readme generator**

The `verb-generate-readme` is a good example of what's possible with verb, and it's an easy way to get started. You can install the library with the following command:

```sh
$ npm i -g verb-generate-readme
```

**.verb.md**

You should now be able to generate your project's readme from a `.verb.md` template with the following command:

```sh
$ verb readme
```

Or you can go a step further by adding a `verbfile.js` to your project, allowing you to customize verb with generators, plugins, middleware, helpers, templates and more!

**verbfile.js**

Next, create a `verbfile.js` with the following code:

```js
module.exports = function(app) {
  app.extendWith('verb-generate-readme');

  // call the `readme` task from verb-generate-readme
  app.task('default', ['readme']);
};
```

## verbfile.js

Write any custom code in your project's `verbfile.js` (like `gulpfile.js` or `Gruntfile.js`). 

**Heads up!**

_If you're using Verb's CLI, `verbfile.js` should export an instance of Verb or a function._

**Function**

When a function is exported, we refer to these as [verb generators](#generators). Generators can be locally or globally installed, and can consist of entirely custom code, or created using other generators and plugins like building blocks.

```js
module.exports = function(app) {
  // "app" is an instance of verb created by Verb's CLI for this file 
};
```

**Instance**

```js
var verb = require('verb');
var app = verb();

module.exports = app;
```

## Config

Options can be defined in `package.json` on the `verb` object. 

**Example**

Specify special data to be used in templates for a project:

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "verb": {
    "data": {
      "twitter": "jonschlinkert"
    }
  }
}
```

See the [config docs](docs/config.md) for more details.

## Command line

### Built-in tasks

Verb only has a few built-in [tasks](docs/tasks.md), but these will externalized to [generators](docs/generators.md) in the near future.

#### list

List currently installed verb [generators](docs/generators.md).

```js
$ verb new
```

#### new

Generate a new [verbfile.js](docs/verbfile.js) in the current working directory.

```js
$ verb new
```

### Config flags

There are a few flags dedicated to setting and persisting configuration settings.

**Flag** | **Type** | **Scope** | **Description** | **Location**
--- | --- | ---
`--option` | In-memory | Global | Set an option to use in the current session | N/A
`--data` | In-memory | Global | Add data to the context for rendering templates in the current session | N/A
`--config` | Persisted | Project | Persist a configuration setting _to use on the current project_ every time `verb` is run | `~/verb-globals.json`
`--set` | Persisted | Persist a configuration setting _to use on every project_ every time `verb` is run | The `verb` object in package.json


### Config examples

#### Settings

Persist configuration settings to the `verb` object in `package.json`. 

```sh
$ verb --config=<options>
```

**Related links**

Persist a list of project names to generate [related links][helpers]{helper-related}:

```sh
$ verb --config=related.list:generate,assemble,update
```

Updates the `verb` object in package.json with the following:

```json
{
  "verb": {
    "related": {
      "list": [
        "generate",
        "assemble",
        "update"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Tasks

Specify tasks to run on a project:

```sh
$ verb --config=tasks:<names>
```

**Example**

Automatically run [verb-generate-readme][] on a project:

```sh
$ verb --config=tasks:readme
# or, specify an array of tasks
$ verb --config=tasks:foo,bar,baz
```

Updates the `verb` object in package.json with the following:

```json
{
  "verb": {
    "tasks": ["readme"]
  }
}
```

### Other flags

#### --init

Initialize a `verb` config object in package.json of the current project.

```sh
$ verb --init
```

#### --save

Persist options values to the global data store for `app` ([verb][], [assemble][], [generate][], [update][], etc)

```sh
$ verb --save <options>
```

Most of the above CLI commands can be prefixed with `--save` to persist the value to the global config store.

#### --file

Specify the file to use instead of `verbfile.js`.

```sh
$ verb --file <filename>
```

**Example**

```sh
$ verb --file foo.js
```

#### --cwd

Specify the cwd to use

```sh
$ verb --cwd=<directory>
```

**Example**

```sh
$ verb --cwd="foo/bar"
```

Display the currently defined cwd:

```sh
$ verb --cwd
```
