## What is verb?

Verb is a documentation system that is simple and fast enough to use for generating the readmes for GitHub projects, but powerful and smart enough to build the most complex documentation projects around. 

Verb is also highly pluggable, with first-class support for instance plugins, pipeline (gulp/vinyl) plugins, routes and middleware, any template engine, helpers, and more. 

## Quickstart

**Install readme generator**

The `verb-readme-generator` is a good example of what's possible with verb, and it's an easy way to get started. You can install the library with the following command:

```sh
$ npm i -g verb-readme-generator
```

**.verb.md**

You should now be able to generate your project's readme from a `.verb.md` template with the following command:

```sh
$ verb readme
```

Or you can go a step further by adding a `verbfile.js` to your project, allowing you to customize verb with generators, plugins, middleware, helpers, templates and more!

**verbfile.js**

Next, create a `verbfile.js` with the following code:

```js
module.exports = function(app) {
  app.extendWith('verb-readme-generator');

  // call the `readme` task from verb-readme-generator
  app.task('default', ['readme']);
};
```

## verbfile

Your project's `verbfile.js` should either export an instance of Verb or a function.

**Instance**

```js
var verb = require('verb');
var app = verb();

module.exports = app;
```

**Function**

When a function is exported, we refer to these as [verb generators](#verb-generators). Verb generators can be locally or globally installed, and can be composed with other verb generators and/or [sub-generators](#sub-generators).

```js
module.exports = function(verb) {
  // "private" verb instance is created for this verbfile
};
```

## CLI Commands

There are several generic flags for setting options from the command line: `option`, `data`, `config` and `save`. Beyond these there are also a number of specialized flags described below.

- `--option`: set options in memory 
- `--data`: set data to be passed to templates in memory 
- `--config`: persist options to package.json
- `--save`: persist options to a global config store

### config

Persist configuration settings to the `verb` object in `package.json`. 

```sh
$ verb --config <options>
```

Most of the above CLI commands can be prefixed with `--config` to persist the value to package.json.


### save

Persist options values to the global data store for `app` ([verb][], [assemble][], [generate][], [update][], etc)

```sh
$ verb --save <options>
```

Most of the above CLI commands can be prefixed with `--save` to persist the value to the global config store.

### file

Specify the file to use instead of `verbfile.js`.

```sh
$ verb --file <filename>
```

**Example**

```sh
$ verb --file foo.js
```

### cwd

Specify the cwd to use

```sh
$ verb --cwd=<directory>
```

**Example**

```sh
$ verb --cwd="foo/bar"
```

Display the currently defined cwd:

```sh
$ verb --cwd
```

#### tasks

Set the default tasks to run for a project:

```sh
$ verb --config=tasks:<tasks>
```

**Example**

```sh
# single task
$ verb --config=tasks:foo

# array of tasks
$ verb --config=tasks:foo,bar,baz
```
